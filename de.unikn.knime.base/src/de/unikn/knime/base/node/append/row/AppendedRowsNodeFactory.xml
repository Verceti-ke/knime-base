		Concatenates two tables row-wise.
	</entry>
	<entry key="fulldescription">
		Concatenates two tables. The top of the output table is given as 
		the first input table (top input port), the bottom as the second table,
		resp. If both tables contain the same column names, they are 
		concatenated (the column type is the common base type of both input 
		column types). If one input table contains a column name that the other
		table doesn't, this column will be in output table as well but it will 
		contain missing values for those row that are given by the table lacking
		this column.
		The dialog allows to treat duplicate row keys, two options are 
		available:

	<entry key="Skip Rows">
		Duplicate row keys in the bottom table are not in the output table.
	</entry>
	<entry key="Append Suffix">
		The output table will contain all rows, but duplicate row keys are 
		labeled with a suffix.
