	    flexible reader for ASCII files.
	</entry>
	<entry key="fulldescription">
		This node can be used to read data from an ASCII file or URL location.
		It can be configured to read in various formats. When you open the 
		node's configuration dialog and provide a filename, it will try to guess
		the reader's settings by analyzing the beginning of the file 
		(after a filename was provided).
		Check the results of these settings in the preview table. If the 
		data showing is not correct or an error is reported, you can adjust the
		settings manually: Check wether column and/or row headers are included
		in the file, enter any column delimiter (or pick a standard
		one from the drop down list), and specify the comment characters. If the
		type or name of a column is not correct, click on the corresponding 
		header in the preview table. In the following dialog you can enter
		a new name and select a new column type. This is also the place to enter
		a pattern that should be interpreted as missing value. In that dialog
		you can also open another dialog to enter the domain (i.e. possible
		values or range) of this column. There you have the choice between
		manually entering the range or possible values, tell the filereader
		to read the values during execution (which is the default anyway), and
		to not set any domain information for this column.
