	    flexible reader for ASCII files.
	</entry>
	<entry key="fulldescription">
		This node can be used to read data from an ASCII file or URL location.
		It can be configured to read in various formats. When you open the 
		node's configuration dialog and provide a filename, it will try to guess the reader's settings 
		by analyzing the beginning of the file (after a filename was provided).
		
		
		In the node's 
		configuration dialog you can specify the separator, the comment 
		characters, column names, etc. (specifics see below) and you get a 
		preview table to verify the settings. 
		
		During execute the node
		will traverse through the entire data once and will fill in possible
		values of nominal attributes and ranges for numerical columns in the
		data table for the successor nodes.
