	<entry key="fulldescription">
 		This node writes out the data table coming in through its input port
 		into a file. The attribute values will be separated by commas. In the
 		configuration dialog of the node, enter a valid destination filename
 		and set a checkmark, if the column headers should be written out (in the
 		first line), and each line should be preceeded by the row ID. Also, a
 		pattern can be specified that should be written out, when an attribute
 		value is missing.
