Contains classes to represent different kinds of coordinate axis. <br>
A coordinate is considered to be a mapping of the real domain range to a given 
absolute range determined by outer constraints (like the screen size).
There exists an abstract class for a coordinate which handles the calculations
and an abstract coordinate mapping class holding the actual mapping.
For different data types exist special implementations dealing wiht the 
different needs ot these types.
