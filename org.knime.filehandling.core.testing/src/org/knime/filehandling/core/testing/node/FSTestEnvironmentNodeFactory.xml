        <intro>
        This node allows to execute the same testflow for a variety of different file systems.
        This node initiates a connection to a file system. The type of file system as well
        as its configuration is defined by the fs-test.properties file. This file can be supplied
        in two ways:
        <ul>
	        <li>By putting it into the root of your KNIME workspace</li>
	        <li>By setting an environment variable called "KNIME_FS_TEST_PROPERTIES", which specifies the file.</li>
        </ul>
