This plugin project provides nodes and functionality as an extension for KNIME.

It is released under the terms of the Aladdin free public license (see the file

The nodes in this plugin are provided for backward compatibility only. They are
all replaced by new nodes with more or different functionality. We (still)
maintain this project only in order to be able to load workflows from older versions. 
The nodes shouldn't be used in new workflows. Neither should the code be called or
used.
