The enrichment plotter node allows you to plot enrichment curves. Enrichment
curves are common in cheminformatics and molecular modeling. A model is trained
on a few number of compounds with known activity and then a large number of
molecules with unknown activity together with the training compounds are
classified by the model. Then the molecules are sorted by the predicted activity
value and a line is plotted where the sum of hits among the first
<tt>x</tt>
compounds is shown on the
<tt>y</tt>
-axis. The steeper the line, the better the enrichment is.
