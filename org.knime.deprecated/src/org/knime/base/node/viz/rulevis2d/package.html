		Provides the classes for the Rule2DNode, a node to display rules 
		(both crisp and fuzzy) in two selectable dimensions, which may 
		also be selected and/or hilited. The rules are displayed in the 
		color defined in the referring RowKey color attribute.
		See de.unikn.knime.core.data.RowKey,
		de.unikn.knime.core.node.property.ColorAttr.
		The underlying data points are also displayed.
		While the normalization of the data is done in the Rule2DPlotter,
		the drawing of the rules actually happens in the class Rule2DDrawingPane.
	</p>
	
	<p >
		Note, the node always expects an de.unikn.knime.core.data.FuzzyIntervalValue 
		per dimension even when it is a crisp rule. Simply make the core the same as 
		the support to obtain crisp rules.
