<body>
The classes in this package are all obsolete. Please use the corresponding
components from the {@link org.knime.core.node.defaultnodesettings defaultnodesettings}
package. The advantage of the new classes over the ones of this package is,
they use "settings models" for storing the value of the components. They provide
a type safe method of retrieving the value and methods for saving and loading
the value.

This Package contains standard components to build up a simple NodeDialog
quickly. DefaultNodeDialog holds a series of Components that can handle
editing, load, and save of standard types, such as doubles, integers,
checkboxes etc.
