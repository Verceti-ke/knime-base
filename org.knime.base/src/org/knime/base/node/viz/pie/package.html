<p>This package contains all classes of the pie chart implementations. Their 
are two pie chart implementation the fixed and the interactive. The fixed 
implementation allows the handling of large data sets but supports no hiliting
and column changes. The interactive implementation supports hiliting and 
interactive column changing.</p>
<p> The pie charts base on the plotter framework.</p>
<p>The datamodel package contains the data models which are generated in the
NodeModel implementation and contain the basic data from the input table to
display.</p>
<p>The impl package contains the controller and view implementations from the 
plotter framework.</p>
<p>The node package contain the knime node implementations.</p>
<p> The util package contains utility classes.</p>
<p>Most of the packages contain of some abstract classes in the root of the 
package and the concrete implementations of these classes in the fixed and
interactive sub packages.</p>
