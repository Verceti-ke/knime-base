  <title>Fixed histogram plotter package</title>
</head>
<body>
This is the memory saving implementation of the abstract histogram plotter. 
The user has to specify the x and y axis in the node configuration and 
can only change the following properties on the fly:
<ol>
	<li>The size of the bars</li>
	<li>The background color</li>
	<li>Aggregation method</li>
	<li>Show/hide missing value bar</li>
	<li>Show/hide empty bars</li>
	<li>Layout options</li>
</ol>
In order to handle huge data sets this node also doesn't supports hiliting.
