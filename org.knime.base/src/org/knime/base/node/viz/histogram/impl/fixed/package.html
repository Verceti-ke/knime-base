  <title>Fixed histogram plotter package</title>
</head>
<body>
This is the memory saving implementation of the abstract histogram plotter. The user
has to specify the x and y axis in the node configuration and can change the 
following properties on the fly:
<ol>
	<li>Number of bars for numerical columns</li>
	<li>The size of the bars</li>
	<li>the background color</li>
	<li>Aggregation method</li>
	<li>Show/hide missing value bar</li>
	<li>Show/hide empty bars</li>
</ol>
This node is applicable for huge data sets since it only holds the neccessary
data in the main memory.
