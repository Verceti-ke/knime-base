<body>
Contains the Statistics Node which can be used to compute statistics based on
the input data table. 
This node has no dialog, so the statistical moments are computed for all
columns.
If you want to compute statistical moments just for some selected columns,
instanciate your own <strong><code>StatisticsTable</code></strong>. The 
statistical values are computed at construction time, therefore multiple calls 
do not influence computational costs.
See <strong><code>StatisticsNodeFactory</code></strong> to instanciate this 
node.
