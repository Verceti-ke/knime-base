	    Plots the numeric columns as lines.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
	    <p>Plots the numeric columns of the input table as lines. All values are
	    mapped to a single y coordinate. This may distort the visualization if the
	    difference of the values in the columns is large.  
		</p>
		
		<h3>HiLiting:</h3>
		<p> The data points may be selected by either dragging
		a rectangle with the mouse over the points or 
		by clicking on points 
		(if the dots are not displayed you won't see the selection or hilite since
		only data points can be selected or hilited). 
		Hold control pressed for multiple selection. 
		The selected datapoints may be 
		hilited by either right-click to get the context menu or via the hilite
		menu in the menu bar.</p>
		
		<h3>Tooltip</h3>
		<p>
		Move the mouse over the data points to get detailed information about 
		the data point (Row ID, and the x and y value).
		</p>
		
		<h3>Properties: </h3>
		<p>Default Settings:
			<ul>
			<li>Mouse Mode: choose "Selection" to select the datapoints or
			"Zooming" to zoom in. If you have zoomed in you may choose "Moving" 
			to navigate in the zoomed display.</li>
			<li>"Fit to screen" fits the display again to the available space.</li>
			<li>"Background color lets you choose the background color of the display. </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Column Selection:
		Choose the columns you want to have displayed as lines. 
		If the visualization is distorted due to great differences between the 
		columns the most distorting columns can be removed to scale the y axis correctly.
		</p>
		<p>Legend: 
		Since the colors of the lines do not depend on the colors of the rows
		(since not the rows, but the columns are displayed as lines) the colors are created
		automatically. Click "Change.." in the legend to change the color of the referring line.
		</p>
		<p>Missing Values:
			Per default missing values will interrupt the line. Check "Interpolate" to 
			linearly interpolate the missing values.
		</p>
		<p>Appearance:
			<ul>
			<li>"Show/Hide dots": Check if the points should
			be displayed explicitely as dots, uncheck if you want to hide the dots.</li>
			<li>"Thickness" lets you define the thickness of the lines.</li>
			<li>"Dot Size" lets you define the size of the dots.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
