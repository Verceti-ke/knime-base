<p>
A scatter plot maps to columns (dimensions) of data to 2-dimensional space, which
results that each row (data instance) can be represented as one 2-dimensional point.

The {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.scatter.ScatterPlotter} maps the 
data to visualize to the screen coordinates. Afterwards a data point is 
represented by a {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.scatter.DotInfo}. All
{@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.scatter.DotInfo}s are stored in a 
{@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.scatter.DotInfoArray} which is passed
to the 
{@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.scatter.ScatterPlotterDrawingPane}.

<p>
For nominal values a jittering is realized. Unhilited dots may be hidden or 
faded, which is the reason for extending the 
{@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.node.DefaultVisualizationNodeView} with the
{@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.scatter.ScatterPlotterNodeView} which adds
the show/hide menu to the menu bar.
