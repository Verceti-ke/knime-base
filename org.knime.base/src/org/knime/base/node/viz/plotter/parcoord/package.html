A ParallelCoordinatePlot is a representation of multi-dimensional information 
or data, in which multiple dimensions are allocated to parallel axes on-screen. 
An object in a data set is then mapped as a series of points, one per axis, 
with the position of each point on the axis being dependent on their value in 
the associated dimension. The points are then joined together by line segments 
from one axis to its immediate neighbour, forming a poly-line across the set of axes.

<p>
The {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.parcoord.ParallelCoordinatesPlotter}
creates the parallel coordinates, represented by either a 
{@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.parcoord.NominalParallelAxis} or a 
{@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.parcoord.NumericParallelAxis} and 
determines their x position. Then the data points of the data to visualize are 
mapped to these coordinates. This results in a 
The {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.parcoord.LineInfo} for each row, 
which is passed to the 
{@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.parcoord.ParallelCoordinateDrawingPane}.
The {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.parcoord.ParallelCoordinateNodeView}
is necessary, since an additional menu is provided to show or hide the unhilited lines.
The {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.parcoord.ParallelCoordinatePlotterProperties}
let the user selected the columns of interest, adjust the line thickness and dot size and
whether the dots are shown or hidden. In addition, the way how missing values are 
handled can be selected:
<ul>
<li>Skip rows containing missing values,</li>
<li>skip missing values which interrupts the lines, or</li>
<li>explicitly show missing values as points on a horizontal line at the bottom</li>
</ul>
