should be displayed. The 
<a href="MultiColumnPlotterProperties.html">MultiColumnPlotterProperties</a> is

<a href="TwoColumnProperties.html">TwoColumnProperties</a> is a properties panel
with the default properties (as defined in

an additional tab where two columns can be selected and the displayed ranges of 
the columns can be adjusted. The

registeres all necessary listeners to the <code>TwoColumnPropeties</code>
