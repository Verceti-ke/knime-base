<body>
The properties for the plotters are organized into small functional units which 
can be added as tabs to the properties panel which is added to the plotter.
This can then be done with this simple code:
<pre>
public SomePlotterProperties() {
	m_someTab = new SomeTab();
    addTab(m_someTab.getDefaultName(), m_someTab);
}
</pre>
The idea behind the organization of the properties into very small functional
units is, that it is reusable. If, for instance, a tab is defined to show or 
hide dots, this may be useful for several plotters, whereas the properties as 
a collection of all this tabs may be to special to extend and reuse it as a
whole. So if there is a need for some control elements it is recommended to 
browse the already existing tabs. If neither fits the needs the policy to define
a tab is as follows: in the constructor the necessary control elements are 
added and layouted and for each control element a getter has to be provided to
let the plotter register the listeners to it.
