    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Writes a model from a PMML model port into a PMML v3.1 compliant 
        file. Select a file to write to. If the file already exist it is 
        silently overwritten! Be sure to have write access to the entered file.
        If a PMML file from another version is read by the PMML Reader and 
        directly written by this node, it is converted into PMML v3.1. 
        If the model is not valid (unknown data types, etc.) an exception is 
        thrown during execution.
