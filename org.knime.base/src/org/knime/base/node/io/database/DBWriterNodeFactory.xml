		<intro>		
	     Establishes and opens a database access connection to which the entire 
	     input data can be written. Make sure you have your personal database 
	     driver registered. The sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver is available
	     by default only but you can use the load button to register additional 
	     drivers from Zip or Jar archives.
		</intro>
		
	<option name="Database driver: ">
		Enter the database driver here; it is a Java class (including the
		package path), for example: sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver
	</option>
	<option name="Load: ">
	    Register additional driver from Zip or Jar files.
	</option>
	<option name="Database name: ">
        Enter the database name here, for example: 
        jdbc:odbc:database_name or jdbc:mysql://host:port/database_name
	</option>
	<option name="User name: ">
        Your log-in user name for the database.
	</option>
	<option name="Password: ">
        Your log-in password for the database. Note, the password is
        de- and encryted everytime before handling it internally and is not 
        stored inside the settings.
	</option>
	<option name="Table name: ">
        Enter the name of the table to which data should be written. Note, if 
        this table exists, the table is dropped before writing.
	</option>
	<option name="SQL types: ">
		Enter the SQL types here to write integer-, double-, or string-valued 
		columns to the database. By default integers are defined as type 
		"integer", doubles as "numeric(10,30)", and all other columns, including
		strings are written as "varchar(255)". Some databases such as MS Access
		and Firebird do not allow this numeric precision, therefore you must
		select "numeric" as the SQL type. If your database allows strings 
		longer than 255 chars, you can change this value in order to write 
		long strings such as SLNs or Smiles.
	</option>
	<option name="Append data: ">
		Check this to append the input data to an existing table with the same
		data structure. If the table does not exist a new one will be created. 
		<b>Note, if this box is unchecked an existing table is dropped before 
		execution of this node.</b>
