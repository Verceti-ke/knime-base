	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
	     Updates the data rows in the database with the data values from the input tables.
	     All selected column names need to exactly match the column names from the database. 
	     The WHERE column values need to match the row to update; whereas the SET column values 
	     are replaced by the input row values. 
	     <br/>
	     The output table contains an additional column with the number of rows affected by the UPDATE statement. 
	     A number greater than or equal to zero -- indicates that the command was processed successfully and is 
	     an update count giving the number of rows in the database that were affected by the command's execution
         A value of -2 -- indicates that the command was processed successfully but that the number of rows affected 
         is unknown.	     
	     <br/>
	     Make sure you have your vendor-specific database driver registered in
         the KNIME preference page (section Database Driver). By default, the 
         sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver (Windows and Linux) is only available.
		</intro>

    <tab name="Settings">
	  <option name="Database Driver">
		Enter the database driver here; it is a Java class (including the
		package path), for example: sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver
		Additional driver can be registered via KNIME's preference page
        (Database Driver).
	  </option>
	  <option name="Database URL">
        Enter the database name here, for example: 
        jdbc:odbc:database_name or jdbc:mysql://host:port/database_name
	  </option>
	  <option name="Workflow Credentials">
        If checked, the credentials (user and password) are used as defined on 
        the workflow. The credential name links to the specified user and 
        password. Those can be replaced or edit using the 'Workflow Credentials'
        menu available in the workflow context menu.

        Your log-in user name for the database.

        stored inside the settings.
	  </option>
      <option name="TimeZone: ">
	    Select the TimeZone to convert the date, time or timestamp field into. The current implementation can't 
	    represent time zones. In order to support persisting those fields into a database, the time values can be change
	    according to the selected time zone, which is used as the raw offset for the original values.
	  </option>
	  <option name="Table Name">
        Enter the name of the table in which the data should be updated.
	  </option>
    </tab>
    <tab name="Column Selection">
	  <option name="SET columns">

        those column values are changing the data in the database. 
	  </option>
	  <option name="WHERE columns">
        Select all columns used for the WHERE clause of the UPDATE statement; 
        those column values need to match the corresponding value in the database 
        in order to make the update.

    <tab name="Advanced">
        <option name="Batch Size">
