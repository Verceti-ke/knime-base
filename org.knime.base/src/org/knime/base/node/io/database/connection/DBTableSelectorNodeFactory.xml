    <shortDescription>Selects a table from a database connection</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node takes a database connection as input and lets you select a table based on the incoming connection.
            The node outputs the incoming connection together with the query which can later on be used in subsequent
            database manipulation nodes.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="SQL Statement">
            Enter SQL statement being execute here, for example SELECT * FROM table.
            <br/>
            Additional SQL commands (create, drop, set parameter, etc.) can be 
            arrange in front of the actual SELECT statement and are execute 
            together line-by-line during configure and execute. Note, those 
            additional SQL commands need to be separated by semicolon.
        </option>
        <option name="Run SQL query only during execute, skips configure">
            The SQL query is executed as it is without accessing the meta info
            from the database during configure, which results in an empty data table
            spec after configure.
        </option>
        <option name="Database Browser">
            Click <i>Fetch Metadata</i> to connect to the database using the
            entered settings and to fetch all tables and display them grouped by 
            type in a tree view.
            Click on any table to retrieve all contained columns. Double-click on a table 
            or column to insert its name into the SQL query at the current 
            cursor position.
        </option>
        <option name="Flow Variable List">
            The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at
            the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
            respective identifier at the current cursor position (replacing the
            selection, if any).
