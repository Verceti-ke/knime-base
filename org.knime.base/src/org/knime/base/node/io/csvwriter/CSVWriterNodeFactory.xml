	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
 		This node writes out the datatable coming through its input port
 		into a file. The attribute values are separated by commas.
 		</intro>
 		<option name="Output file location">Enter a valid file name or URL. 
			You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down list,
			or select a file from the "Browse..." dialog.
			</option>		
 		<option name="Missing Pattern">Enter a pattern that will be written out
 		    for missing values.
			</option>		
 		<option name="Write Column Header">If checked, the column names will be
 			written out in the first line of the output file.
			</option>		
 		<option name="Skip column header when appended">
 			If checked, the column header will not be written when appended to
 			the output file. This is particularly useful when the csv writer is
 			used in a LOOPER node to report results. This option is ignored
 			when the column header is not written anyway or the file append option
 			is unset (see below).
			</option>		
 		<option name="Write Row Header">If checked, the row headers will be
 			added to the output, as first item in each row.
			</option>		
 		<option name="Append to output file">If checked, the output is appended
 		to the output file (if it exists). If not checked and the file does 
 		exist, the file will be overwritten.
			</option>
