	<name>Looping File Reader</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    Flexible reader for ASCII files.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>	
		Provides the same functionality as the File Reader (please refer to
		the File Reader's page).
		Additionally this reader's dialog has a tab where you can enter 
		additional files that will be read after the file in the dialog's 
		"main" location. The dialog only looks at its "main" file and
		determines the settings from it - all other additional files must be 
		readable with these settings.
		</intro>

	    <option name="Variable name">If you enter a variable name here, the
	    file name will be pushed on KNIME's variable stack, for successor
	    nodes in the loop to read. If left empty, the name is not stored on
	    the variable stack. 
        </option>	      	
        <option name="File list">Enter in each line the name of an additional
        file to read with the same settings entered in the main dialog page.
        Absolute paths must start with a '/', '\', or 'X:'. Relative paths are
        relative to their predecessor file. 
        </option>
