    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Performs a cross join of two tables. Each row of the first table is joined with 
        each row of the second table. Note, this is an extremely expensive operation as the number of rows in the
        output is the product of both input table row counts. </intro>
        <option name="Second table column suffix">
        The suffix attached to a column's name if the second table contains a column with the same name.
        The column names of the first inport are always retained. If there are duplicates found in the second table
        the suffix is added once or multiple times to ensure uniqueness.
