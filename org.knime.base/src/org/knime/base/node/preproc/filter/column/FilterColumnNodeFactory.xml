		<intro>
			This node allows columns to be filtered from the input table while 
			only the remaining columns are passed to the output table. Within 
			the dialog, columns can be moved between the Include and Exclude 
			list.
		</intro>
		
		<option name="Include">
			This list contains the column names that are included in the 
			output table.
		</option>
		
		<option name="Select">
			Use these buttons to move columns between the Include and Exclude 
			list.
		</option>
		
		<option name="Search">
			Use one of these fields to search either within the Include
			or Exclude list for certain column names or name substrings.
			Repeated clicking of the search button marks the next column that 
			matches the search text. The check box 'Mark all search hits' causes
			all matching columns to be selected making them movable between
			the two lists.
