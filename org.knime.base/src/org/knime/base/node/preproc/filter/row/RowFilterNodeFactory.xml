	<name>Row Filter</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Allows filtering of datarows by certain criteria, such as row ID, 
		attribute value, and row number range.  
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>The node allows for row filtering according to certain criteria. 
		It can include
 		or exclude: certain ranges (by row number), rows with
 		a certain row ID, and rows with a certain value in a
 		selectable column (attribute). Below are the steps on how to configure the node
 		in its configuration dialog.
		</intro>

		<option name="In- or exclude rows by criteria">You must first select which criteria should
		 be used for filtering from the left-hand side. Also choose
			whether to include or exclude rows according to the selected criteria. 
			Depending on the choice, you will then have to adjust the filter parameters in the right-hand panel.
		</option>
		<option name="Column value matching">If filter by attribute value is 
			selected, select the name of the column whose value should be matched. Then,
			either enter a regular expression for string matching, or a value range,
			for range filtering. When using a regular expression, you can set a checkmark, 
			if you want a case sensitive match to be made. If a range is specified,
			you specify only one boundary, the other is then set to
			(plus or minus) infinity.
		</option>
	    <option name="Row number range">If filter by range is selected, specify
		    the first row number to in/exclude. The end of the range can either 
		    be specified by row number, or set to the end of the table, causing 
		    all remaining rows to be in/excluded.
		</option>
	    <option name="Row ID pattern">If filter by row key is selected, specify
	    	a regular expression, which is matched against the row ID of each row.
	    	A checkmark can be set, if a case sensitive match should be performed
	    	and if the row ID should start with the specified pattern.
		</option>
