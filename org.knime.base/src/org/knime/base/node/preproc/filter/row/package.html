<p>
Contains a node filtering out rows from an input data table,
including only those rows into the output/result table that match a certain
criteria.</p>
<p>
The matching criteria is specified in a row filter. The filter node takes only
one row filter - this row filter could contain a combination of multiple
others though. See the <code>rowfilter</code> package for available filters and
for details on how to implement a new row filter.</p>
