	<name>Constant Value Column Filter</name>
	<shortDescription> The Constant Value Column Filter filters columns
		containing only duplicates of the same value. 
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro> This node filters columns containing only duplicates of the
			same value from the input data table. Examples include a column
			containing only zeroes, a column containing only identical strings,
			or a column comprising only empty / missing cells. In a dialog
			window, the user can choose which columns to consider for filtering.
			Columns excluded in this dialog are passed even if they contain only
			identical values.
		</intro>
		<option name="Filter"> This list contains the column names of the input
			table that are to be considered for filtering.
		</option>
		<option name="Select"> Use these buttons to move columns between the
			Filter and Pass list.
		</option>
		<option name="Search"> Use one of these fields to search either within
			the Filter or Pass list for certain column names or name substrings.
			Repeated clicking of the search button marks the next column that
			matches the search text. The check box 'Mark all search hits' causes
			all matching columns to be selected making them movable between the
			two lists.
		</option>
		<option name="Pass"> This list contains the column names of the input
			table that are passed to the output without undergoing filtering.
