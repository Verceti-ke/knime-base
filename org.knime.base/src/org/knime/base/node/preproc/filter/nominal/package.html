<body>
This package implements a possible value row filter. A nominal column
can be selected and several values from the possible values of this column.
The input data is then splitted into two output tables: one containing 
matching rows (rows which have one of the included possible values) and one
for the non-matching rows (rows which do not have a value like one of 
the selected ones).
