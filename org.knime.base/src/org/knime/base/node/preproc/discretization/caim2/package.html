<body>
Contains two nodes for class supervised binning and applying such a learned
binning model to new data. The functionality is located in the subpackages
modelcreator and modelapply. The classes in this package represent a
discretization (binning) model and are used by both nodes.

The package has been renamed to caim2 when the node dialog got re-implemented
with the new default settings.
