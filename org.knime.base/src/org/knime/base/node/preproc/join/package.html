<body>
	Convenience node that joins two tables.
	The join on the two tables is carried out such that the first table 
	appears on the left side of the new table and the second one on the 
	right side. Thus, the output table has as many rows as the input tables
	(if the IDs in both tables match) and as many columns as the sum of 
	both column counts. The join is based on matching row keys. If a row key
	only occurs in one of the two tables, the remaining part is filled with
	missing cells.
