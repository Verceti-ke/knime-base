<body>
	Contains the implementation of a node that splits (and replaces) a values in a column 
	into multiple new ones. It splits the content of a selected column depending
	on a specified delimiter and puts the resulting parts into new columns.<br>
	The actual work of splitting the value and creating the new data cells is
	done in the {@link org.knime.base.node.preproc.cellsplit.CellSplitterCellFactory},
	that is used by the column rearranger table, created during the NodeModel's execute
	({@link org.knime.base.node.preproc.cellsplit.CellSplitterNodeModel}).<br>
	The implementation uses a settings object 
	{@link org.knime.base.node.preproc.cellsplit.CellSplitterUserSettings} to
	store the user settings and to transfer them between the different 
	objects (this object takes care of saving and loading them into KNIME's
	NodeSettings object). This object is extended to
	{@link org.knime.base.node.preproc.cellsplit.CellSplitterSettings} to
	hold (and transfer) settings like guessed number of columns and column types.
