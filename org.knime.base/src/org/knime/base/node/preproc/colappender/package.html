<body>
The column appender node appends the columns of a table to another table. The
user can choose two column in the two tables that contain the values upon which
the rows are joined. The rows of the first table are always contained in the
output table, values from rows from the second table only appear in the output
if they match at least one row in the first table. If the join column in the
second table contains the same column multiple times only the values from the 
first row are appended and a warning is issued.<br />
For the joining to be performed efficiently both tables are sorted prior before
joining them. This means that also the output table will be sorted. The user
can also choose to do the sorting completely in memory (which may fail if the
tables are too big). Additionally rows from the first table that have no
matching counterpart in the second table may be removed from the output.
