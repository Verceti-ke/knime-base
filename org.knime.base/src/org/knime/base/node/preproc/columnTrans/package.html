<body>
This package contains the classes of the Many2One and One2Many column 
transformation nodes. The One2Many node creates for each distinct value of
the
selected column(s) a new column with the value as name. The Many2One node 
creates a new column from multiple columns with the name of the column 
which matches the include criteria as value.
<p>
<p>Both nodes use the {@link org.knime.core.data.container.ColumnRearranger}

class to append the result columns to the input table. The 
<code>ColumnRearranger</code> is fed by the different factory classes which 
implement the {@link org.knime.core.data.container.CellFactory} interface.
