  Implementation of the Fisher Yates shuffle, that guarantees that 
  all n! possible outcomes are possible and equally likely. The shuffling
  procedure requires only linear runtime. However, the implementation is
  quite slow because the original DataRows need to be assigned to the 
  shuffled rowkeys. For further details see  
  "Fisher-Yates shuffle", from Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures,
  Paul E. Black, ed., NIST.
