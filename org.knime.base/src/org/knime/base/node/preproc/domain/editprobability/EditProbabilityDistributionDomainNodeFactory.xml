	<name>Edit Nominal Probability Distribution</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Edits the possible values of nominal probability distribution columns.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				It is used to manipulate the possible values of
				nominal probability
				distribution columns.
				It is possible to interactively insert or
				remove possible values, as well
				as resetting the initial
				configuration. This allows the configuration of the downstream nodes
				to be applied on the amended probability classes.
				The sorting of the
				probability
				classes is also possible. This might be beneficial in
				case specific
				probability classes need to be monitored and this way
				they can be
				put first in
				the list of possible values.

		<option name="Select column">
			Selects the probability distribution column which
			needs to be edited.
			All the other column types are filtered out. A
			column name with red
			border indicates that the column was previously
			modified but
			either
			it doesn't exist anymore or its type has
			changed (not a
			probability
			distribution column anymore). Red written domain values
			orderings can
			be edited as others and in addition deleted. (See the
			<b>Reset/Delete</b>
			option).
		</option>
		<option name="Add">Inserts a new value at the selected position.
			Newly created values are marked as green.
		</option>
		<option name="Remove">Removes all the selected values.
		</option>
		<option name="Sort alphabetically [A-Z, Z-A]">Sorts the probability classes in alphabetical order
			ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A).
		</option>
		<option name="Move one step [Up, Down]">Moves the selected element(s) one position up or
			down. If
			the top or the bottom of the list is reached, the selected
			element(s)
			is/are enqueued on the other end of the table again.
		</option>
		<option name="Move first/last">Moves the selected element(s) to the top or at the
			end of the table.
		</option>
		<option name="Reset/Delete">Restores the original probability distribution
			classes as in the input table. If a not existing, but previously
			modified column is selected (written in red), this button is
			marked with 'Delete' and deletes the stored modifications for the
			selected column.
		</option>
		<option name="If a modified column is not present in data">
			Determines whether the execution should either fail or
			the column should be ignored if a modified column does not exist
			in the input table.
		</option>
		<option name="If a modified column has an incompatible type">
			Determines whether the execution should either fail or
			the column should be ignored if the type of the modified column is
			not compatible with a probability distribution column.
		</option>
		<option name="Precision (number of decimal digits)">
			Defines the precision that the sum of the
			probabilities must have by
			restricting the number of decimal digits that must be precise.
			The
			sum
			is accepted if
			<i>abs(sum - 1) &lt;= 10^(-precision)</i>
			, e.g., if the sum is 0.999, it is only accepted
			with a precision of
			&lt;=2. The lower the specified number, the higher is the tolerance.
