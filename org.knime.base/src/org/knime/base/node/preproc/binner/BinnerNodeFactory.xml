		<intro>		
	    Groups values of numeric columns into string-type categories. 
	    For each column a number of intervals (bins) can be defined. Each of 
	    these bins has a unique name 
	    (for this column), a range, and open or closed interval 
	    borders. It automatically ensures that the ranges are defined 
	    in descending order and that interval borders are consistent.
	    In addition, each column can be either replaced with the binned, 
	    string-type column or a new binned, string-type column is appended.
		</intro>
		
		<option name="Select Column: ">
		First select a column and then use the "Add" button to create the 
		desired number of bins. Each bin can be modified in the lower part of 
		the panel once it has been selected.
        Each interval has to be defined independently or can be removed using
        the "Removed" button. Note that the range as well as bin 
	    borders are automatically adjusted, if necessary.
		</option>
		<option name="Append new Column: ">
		If selected, a new column name can be specified. This name is used to
		append a new binned column. The input column is kept.
		</option>
