    <shortDescription>Splits table into two partitions.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	        The input table is split into two partitions (i.e. row-wise),
			e.g. train and test data. The two partitions are available at the
			two output ports. The following options are available in the dialog:
		</intro>
		<option name="Absolute">
			Specify the absolute number of rows in the first partition. If there are
			less rows than specified here, all rows are entered into the first 
			table, while the second table contains no rows.
		</option>
		<option name="Relative">
			The percentage of the number of rows in the input table that are
			in the first partition. It must be between 0 and 100, inclusively.
		</option>
		<option name="Draw randomly">
			The sampling should be done randomly. If this is not checked the first partition
			is taken from the top of the input table.
		</option>
		<option name="Seed">
			Check this button and add a random seed to have deterministic 
			sampling, i.e. each execution results in the same partitioning. 
			If you do not specify a random seed, the partitioning will differ
	        when the node is re-executed.
		</option>
