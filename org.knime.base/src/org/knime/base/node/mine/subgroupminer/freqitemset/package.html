<body>
This package contains the necessary data structures for the subgroup mining.
A frequent itemset, a frequent itemset row with a fixed length but a variable
length of items inside (the rest is filled with empty cells), and a 
FrequentItemset table, where the rows can be sorted by the itemset length
which is not possible with the normal sorter.
