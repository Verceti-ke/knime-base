<body>
This package contains two algorithm implementations for the SubgroupMinerNode.
The ArrayApriori algorithm realizes the apriori algorithm with the help
of a prefix tree, where the nodes are arrays, each containing a counter at the
corresponding position.
The TIDAprioriAlgorithm is indeed an Eclat implementation, since it realizes
the subgroup mining in a depth-first-search manner by combining
the transaction ids of each item with the other ones.
