	<name>PNN Predictor</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    Applies unknown data to a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN).
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
	    The first input port contains the test data while the second one 
	    contains the PNN Model to which the data is applied. The output data has one additional column
	    containing the predicted class attribute.
		</intro>
		
	    <option name="Choose Name">
			The name of the predicted column appended to the end of the test 
			data.    
		</option>
	    <option name="Don't Know Class">
		    A probability between 0.0 and 1.0. Instances where the activation lies 
		    above this threshold are classified as a missing (unknown) class. 
		    This is useful in cases where the feature space is not completely 
		    covered by rules.
	    </option>

			PNN model used to classify the test data.
