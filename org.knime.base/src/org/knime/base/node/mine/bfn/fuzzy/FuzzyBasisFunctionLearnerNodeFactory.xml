	<name>Fuzzy Rule Learner</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    Trains a Fuzzy Rule Model on labeled data.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
    	Generates fuzzy rules on labeled data using 
    	<a href="http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/bioml2/publications/Papers2003/Bert03_mixedFR_ijar.pdf">
    	Mixed Fuzzy Rule Formation</a> as the underlying training algorithm 
    	(also known as RecBF-DDA algorithm).
    	See <a href="http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/bioml2/publications/Papers2004/GaBe04_mixedFRappendix_ijar.pdf">
    	Influence of fuzzy norms and other heuristics on 
    	"Mixed Fuzzy Rule Formation"</a> for an extension.<br />
    	All numeric columns of the input data are used as input columns for 
    	training and one (additional) column is used as a classification 
    	target.<br />
    	The data output port contains one fuzzy interval for each dimension plus
    	the target classification. The model outport contains the Fuzzy Rule
    	Model, which can be used for classification in the Fuzzy Rule Predictor 
    	node.<br />
    	The algorithm generates rules based on input data, which can be 
    	described as fuzzy intervals in higher dimensional spaces. These 
    	hyper-rectangles are defined by trapezoid fuzzy membership functions for
    	each dimension.

	<option name="Target Column">
		Select the target to be used as the classification attribute.
	</option>
	<option name="Missing Values">
	    Select one method to handle missing values: "Incorp" may generate fuzzy 
	    rules with missing values if no replacement value has been 
	    found during the learning process. "Best Guess" computes the optimal
	    replacement value by projecting the fuzzy rule (with missing value(s))
	    to the missing dimension(s) of all other rules. "Mean", "Min", and "Max"
	    replace the missing value with each column's statistical property. 
	    "Zero" and "One" perform a constant replacement by inserting either zero
	    or one.
	</option>
	<option name="Properties">
	    If this is selected, a shrink should be performed immediately after a 
	    new rule has been introduced, i.e. the new rule is reduced so that 
	    conflicts with all other rules of different classes are avoided.
	</option>
    <option name="Maximum #Epochs">
    	If this is selected, this option defines the maximum number of epochs 
    	the algorithm has to process the entire data set, otherwise it repeats 
    	this process until this rule model is stable, i.e. no new rule has been 
    	commited and/or no shrink has been executed.
	</option>
	<option name="Fuzzy Norm">
	    Select one fuzzy norm to compute the rules' fulfillment across all
	    dimensions and rules. Fuzzy norms are important, because they combine 
	    the membership values of each fuzzy interval for one rule and compute a
	    final output across all rules. Different choices of fuzzy norms are 
	    available: minimum/maximum, product, Lukasiewicz, and Yager norm.
	</option>
	<option name="Shrink Function">
	    Select one shrink method to reduce rules in order to avoid conflicts 
	    between rules of different classes. There are three volume-based shrink
	    method available to normalize the loss in volume: the border-based 
	    shrink applies the volume loss in terms of the support or core region 
	    borders; the anchor-based shrink uses the anchor value border; and the 
	    rule-based shrink uses the entire rule volume.
