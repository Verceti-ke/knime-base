	<name>Fuzzy Rule Predictor</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    Applies unknown data to a Fuzzy Rule Model.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
	    The first input port contains the test data while the second contains the
	    Fuzzy Rule Model that
	    is applied to the data. The output data has one additional column 
		containing the predicted class attribute.
		</intro>
		
	    <option name="Choose Name">
			The name of the predicted column appended to the end of the test 
			data.    
		</option>
	    <option name="Don't Know Class">
		    A probability between 0.0 and 1.0. Instances where the activation lies 
		    above this threshold are classified as a missing (unknown) class. 
		    This is useful in cases where the feature space is not completely 
		    covered by rules.
	    </option>
