		<intro>		
	    Applies unknown data to a Fuzzy Rule Model. The first input port 
	    contains the test data and the second contains the Fuzzy Rule Model that
	    is applied to the data. The output data has one additional column with 
	    the predicted class attribute.
		</intro>
		
	    <option name="Choose Name">
			The name of the predicted column, appended at the end to the test 
			data.    
		</option>
	    <option name="Don't Know Class">
		    A probability between 0.0 and 1.0. Instances where activation lies 
		    above this threshold are classified with an unknown missing class. 
		    This is useful in cases where the feature space is not completely 
		    covered by rules.
