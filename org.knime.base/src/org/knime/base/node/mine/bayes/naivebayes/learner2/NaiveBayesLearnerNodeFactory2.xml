	<shortDescription>
		Creates a naive Bayes model from the given classified data.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The node creates a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Bayesian model</a> from 
			the given training data. It
			calculates the number of rows per attribute value per class for
			nominal attributes and the Gaussian distribution for numerical
			attributes. The created model could be used in the naive Bayes
			predictor to predict the class membership of unclassified data.
            
            The node displays a warning message if any columns are ignored due to unsupported data types.
            For example Bit Vector columns are ignored when the PMML compatibility flag is enabled since they are 
            not supported by the PMML standard.
		</intro>
		<option name="Classification Column">
		    The class value column.
	    </option>
        <option name="Maximum number of unique nominal values per attribute">
            All nominal columns with more unique values than the defined number
            will be skipped during learning.
        </option>
        <option name="Default probability">
            A probability of zero for a given attribute/class value pair requires special attention. 
            Without adjustment, a probability of zero would exercise an absolute veto over a likelihood in which that 
            probability appears as a factor. Therefore, the Bayes model incorporates a default probability parameter 
            that specifies a default (usually very small) probability to use in lieu of zero probability for a 
            given attribute/class value pair. Set to zero for no correction.
        </option>
        <option name="Ignore missing values">
            By default the node uses the missing value information to improve the class probability calculation but can 
            be disabled by selecting this option.
            Since the PMML standard does not support this option and ignores missing values this option is disabled 
            if the PMML compatibility option is selected and missing values are ignored.
            
            Be aware that if missing values are considered during prediction the result might be different to the
            PMML compatible model.
        </option>
		<option name="Create PMML 4.2 compatible model">
			Select this option to create a model which is compliant with the 
            <a href="http://www.dmg.org/v4-2/NaiveBayes.html">PMML 4.2 standard</a>.
            Missing values as well as columns that contain bit vectors are ignored during learning and prediction if 
            this option is ticked.
