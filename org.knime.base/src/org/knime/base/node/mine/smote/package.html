	<p>Node that oversample patterns in an input table.</p>
	<p>The algorithm works roughly as follows: It oversamples patterns of 
		a given class by drawing random representatives from the input table,
		calculating their kNNs and then choosing any nearest neighbor and 
		putting the new pattern along the line between the representative 
		and its nearest neighbor.
	<p>
		The implementation is based on the 
		<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume16/chawla02a.pdf">SMOTE</a> algorithm:
