    <shortDescription>Compares two columns by their attribute value pairs.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Compares two columns by their attribute value pairs and shows the 
		    confusion matrix, i.e. how many rows of which attribute and their 
		    classification match. 
		    Additionally, it is possible to hilight cells of this matrix to
		    determine the underlying rows.
		    The dialog allows you to select two columns for comparison;
			the values from the first selected column are represented in the 
			confusion matrix's rows and the values from the second column by the
			confusion matrix's columns. The output of the node is the confusion 
			matrix with the number of matches in each cell.
			Additionally, the second out-port reports a number of 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">
			accuracy statistics</a> such as True-Positives, False-Positives, 
			True-Negatives, False-Negatives, Recall, Precision, Sensitivity, 
			Specifity, F-measure, as well as the overall accuracy.

			Displays the confusion matrix in a table view. It is possible
			to hilight cells of the matrix which propagates highlighting
			to the corresponding rows. Therefore, it is possible for example to 
			identify wrong predictions.
