        <intro>
			Compares two columns by their attribute value pairs and shows the 
		    confusion matrix, i.e. how many rows of which attribute and their classification. 
		    Additionally, it is possible to hilight cells of this matrix do
		    determine the data rows that have been predicted wrongly.
		    The dialog allows you to select two columns to compare;
			the values from the first selected column are represented in the 
			confusion matrix's rows and the values from the second column by the
			confusion matrix's columns. The output of the node is the confusion 
			matrix.
