<body>
	Node that performs an entropy calculation and compares two clustering results.
	The node has two inputs (one containing the reference clustering in one of its
	columns and the second containing the clustering results to evaluate) and no 
	outport. The view to the node shows some basic statistics like entropy, some
	quality value, number of clusters, patterns, etc.
