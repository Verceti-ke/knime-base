	<shortDescription>Creates a crisp center based clustering.</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node outputs the cluster centers for a predefined number of
			clusters (no dynamic number of clusters).
			K-means performs a crisp
			clustering that assigns a data
			vector to exactly one cluster. The
			algorithm terminates when the
			cluster assignments do not change
			anymore.
			<br />
			The clustering algorithm uses the Euclidean distance on the selected
			attributes. The data is not normalized by the node (if required,
			you
			should consider to use the "Normalizer" as a preprocessing step).
		</intro>
		<option name="Number of clusters">
			The number of clusters (cluster centers) to be
			created.
		</option>
		<option name="Centroid initialization">
			Allows to pick the centroid initialization method.
			<i>First k rows</i>
			initializes the centroids using the first rows of the input table.
			<i>Random initialization</i>
			initializes the centroids with random rows of the input table.
			When
			picking the
			<i>Random initialization</i>
			,
			by checking the
			<i>Use static random seed</i>
			it is possible to get reproducible results (same centroids for the
			same
			seed). The static random seed value can be controlled by
			manipulating the
			corresponding flow variable named:
			<i>centroid_seeds</i>
			<br />
			<b>Note:</b>
			The choice between the centroid initialization methods can be
			controlled by a flow variable as well, named:
			<i>centroid_initialization</i>
			. The default option:
			<i>Random initialization</i>
			will be picked if a string "RANDOM_INITIALIZATION" is fed to this
			variable, while for
			<i>First k rows</i>
			option the flow variable needs to be set "FIRST_ROWS".
		</option>
		<option name="Max number of iterations">
			The number of iterations after which the
			algorithm
			terminates,
			independent of the accuracy improvement of the
			cluster
			centers.
		</option>
		<option name="Numeric Column Selection">
			Move the numeric columns of interest
			to the "Include" list.
			<i>Always include all columns</i>
			option moves all numeric columns to the "Include" list by default.
		</option>
		<option name="Enable Hilite Mapping">
			If enabled, the hiliting of a cluster row (2nd
			output) will hilite all
			rows of this
			cluster in the input table and
			the
			1st output table. Depending on the
			number
			of rows, enabling this
			feature might consume a lot of memory.
