<body>
Contains the Sota node, which can be used for clustering hirarchically
numerical and fuzzy data and visualize the resulting cluster tree.
This node has a dialog, in wich one can choose the winner, ancestor and
sister learningrate, to adjust the cluster representants with, the 
minimal resource and variability value to stop the growing of the tree, the
minimal error, to end a cycle and the distance metric (cosinus, euclidean).
The node will cluster the given data hirarchically by use of the self
organizing tree algorithm and will produce a cluster tree, which is
visualized by the view afterwards similarily like a dendogram.
The dats is displayed too and can be hilited, as well as each cluster 
representant.
See <strong><code>SotaNodeFactory</code></strong> to instanciate this 
node.
