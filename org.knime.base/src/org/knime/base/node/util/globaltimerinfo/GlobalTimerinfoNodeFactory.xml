        <intro>
        <p>This node reports collected usage information for nodes for the life span of this KNIME installation.
        </p>
        <p>The output table at the first port lists all nodes (the class names) that were created or executed during
		the life time of this installation. The additional columns list aggregate execution times of all instances
		of that nodes (in milli seconds), how often instances of this nodes were executed, and often they were
		manually created (not counting copy and paste actions!). The last column finally shows the most likely
		successor for each node. This information is likely not that useful for a single installation but provides
		us at KNIME with aggregate usage statistics and will allows us to provide recommendations in the future.
		</p>
		<p>The second port shows all installed features of this KNIME installation together with their version
		numbers.
