    <name>Timer Info</name>
    
    <shortDescription>Collects all timer information from nodes in this workflow.</shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        <p>This node reports individual and aggregate timing/execution information for all nodes
        of the workflow (at this level).
        </p>
        <p>
        The output table lists all nodes in the workflow that were executed since the last reset.
        Additional columns show aggregate execution times (e.g. over multiple loop iterations),
        execution time since the last reset (e.g. in the last iteration), and the corresponding
        counts. The last two columns contain the node ID and full package name.
        </p>
        <p>
        All times are reported in milliseconds.
