    <name>Backward Feature Elimination Filter</name>

    <shortDescription>Applies a feature filter model built during backward feature elimination</shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node takes a model built with a feature elimination loop and lets you choose the column you want to
            include in the output table. The dialog will show you all computed levels of the feature elimination
            together with the error rates. You may then select one level and all columns from the input table that are
            not present in the selected level are filtered from the input table. You may optionally include the target
            column. Note that the column names must be the same as the ones used for the elimination loop. If they are
            not, rename them first.
