	<name>Cross validation</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
		Node for performing cross validations.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>This node is used for cross validation. The internal workflow
			provides input nodes for training, test data, and an output node
			that collects the results of the different iterations. The user must
			add at least a learner and its predictor to the internal workflow
			and add appropiate connections. The internal workflow is then
			executed as many times as iterations should be performed. In the end
			the two output ports contain the confusion matrix and a simple error
			rate.
		</intro>
		<option name="Number of validations">The number of cross validation
			iterations that should be performed.</option>
		<option name="Random sampling">If checked, the partitions are sampled
			randomly from the input table, otherwise it is cut into consecutive
			pieces.</option>
		<option name="Class column name">The name of the column with the class labels.</option>		
        <option name="Leave-one-out">Performs a leave-one-out cross validation, i.e. there are as many iterations as
        data points and in each iteration another point's target value is predicted by using all remaining points as training set.</option>
