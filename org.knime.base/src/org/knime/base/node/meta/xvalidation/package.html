The
<b>xvalidation</b>
package contains all classes for a cross validation flow. The workflow between
the {@link org.knime.base.node.meta.xvalidation.XValidatePartitionModel} node and
the {@link org.knime.base.node.meta.xvalidation.AggregateOutputNodeModel}
node should consist of at least a learner and its predictor. The output of
the predictor should be connected to the aggregator node. The class column set
in the aggregator node and the predictor has to be the same.
