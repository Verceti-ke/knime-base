The <b>xvalidation</b> package contains all classes for the cross validation node.
The cross validation node is derived from {@link MetaNodeModel} and
offers an internal workflow. When a new cross validation node is created it contains (in addition
to the normal in- and output node) a cross validation partitioner that splits the incoming
data into training and test data set. It is configured via the outer cross validation node
(e.g. number of validations, random sampling). This node cannot be deleted as it is crucial for
the functionality of the cross validation node.<br />
The inner workflow should consists of at least some learner and its predictor. The output
of the predictor should be connected to the meta output node. The class column set in the cross validation
node and the predictor has to be the same.<br />
The cross validation nodes' view shows a confusion matrix, its output port offers a table with the
error rates of each validation run.
