    <name>Recursive Loop End</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
    The loop end node for recursion. This type of loop enables you to receive data from the loop end.

        <intro>
        
        Using the recursive loop construct you have the possibility to receive a data table passed to a 
        corresponding loop end back in the loop start node. 
        
        First the loop start node needs an initialization table. This table is output in the first iteration of the recursive loop.
        
        The corresponding loop end receives a data table and passes it back to the loop start node.
        Starting with the second iteration of the recursive loop the loop start node outputs the data as inserted into the loop end in the previous run.
        
        The data passed to port 0 is collected and passed to the output. 
        The data in port 1 is returned to the recursive loop start.
        </intro>
        <option name="Maximal number of iterations">The loop will stop after these number of iterations, to ensure no endless loop is created.</option>
        <option name="Minimal number of rows">The minimal number of rows passed back to the loop start. If the input contains less rows, the loop ends.</option>
        <option name="Collect data from last iteration only">If this option is checked only the last input to the collecting data port is passed through to the outport. Hence, the data of earlier iterations is discarded.</option>  
        <option name="End loop">Use a flow variable for this option if you want to have an optional possibility to stop the loop.</option>   
        <option name="Add iteration column">Allows you to add a column containing the iteration number to the output table.</option>
