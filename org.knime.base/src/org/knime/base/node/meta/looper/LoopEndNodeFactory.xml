        <intro>
            Node at the end of a loop. It is used to mark the end of a workflow loop and collects the 
            intermediate results by row-wise concatenation of the incoming tables. The start of the loop is defined by the
            loop start node, in which you can define how often the loop should be executed (either fixed or 
            derived from data, e.g. the "group loop start"). All nodes in between are executed that many times.

        <option name="Add iteration column">Allows you to add a column containing the iteration number to the output table.</option>
        <option name="Uniquify row IDs">If set, the iteration number is added to each row ID from the incoming table, thus making
            the row IDs unique over all iterations. If unset, the incoming row keys are not altered. In this case you
            have to make sure that there are not duplicate row IDs in different iterations. Otherwise an error occurs.
