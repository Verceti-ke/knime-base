This package contains the basic viewing framework for KNIME. Its main elements
are so-called plotters. A plotter consists of four elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plotter which does the mapping of points to screen coordinates and is
the composite element. </li>
<li>
The DrawingPane where the actual drawing is done. The drawing pane knows nothing 
about the domain values but only the screen coordinates.
</li>
<li>
The ScrollPane. The drawing pane is embedded in a scroll pane. The scroll pane
represents a coordinate system with the x axis from left to right and a y 
axis from bottom to top! (Different from java built-in coordinate system.)
</li>
<li>
A properties panel, which contains the control elements for the plotter. 
Should be extended in order to keep the core functionality available.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There exists a hierarchy of plotters each adds some functionality. 
They may be extended at every point in the hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>
The most abstract plotter is the AbstractPlotter which provides functionality of
selection, zooming, moving and correctly resizing the component. 
Although it is an abstract plotter X and Y axis may be set.
</p>
<p>
The next plotter in the hierarchy is the basic plotter which provides 
functionality to plot basic drawing elements such as lines (polygons), ellipses 
and rectangles. The plotter comes along with these basic elements but also let
you define your own basic drawing element and add it to the drawing pane.
</p>
<p>
The next sub branch of the basic plotter is the two column plotter which plots 
two selectable columns.
