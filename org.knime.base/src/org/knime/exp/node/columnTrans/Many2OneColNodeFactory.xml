		<intro>
		Aggregates several columns into one single column.
			Selects a matching column from the selected columns and puts the name 
			of the matching column into the aggregated column of that row.
			Dependend on the selected "include method" a column matches the 
			include pattern for each row. 
			Then the name of that column is put into the aggregated column, i.e.
			the aggregated column contains the column names of the selected columns. 
			If no column matches a missing value is added.
			If multiple columns match an exception is thrown.
			Missing values are ignored. If all selected columns of one row consist
			of missing values a missing value is put in the aggregated column.
			All include methods except the regular expression require columns 
			which are double compatible.
